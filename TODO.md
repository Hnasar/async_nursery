## Questions

- compare unicycle to FuturesUnordered. -> It might be good in itself, but the problem it solves doesn't matter to us. Main issue right now is the overhead of the channel.

## Tests

- check code coverage and add tests.
- loom tests.
- test what happens if spawner is not 'static
- verify drop behavior of futures unordered

## Features

- add timeout support.
- consider being channel agnostic?
- cooperative canceling
